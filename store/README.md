# STORE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Creating a file in this directory activate the option in the framework automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).

Nuxt.js lets you have a store directory with every file corresponding to a module.
If you want this option, export the state as a function, 
and the mutations and actions as objects in store/index.js instead of a store instance
